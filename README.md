# PersistentHotspot
Following a recent update in Windows 10, the Wifi Hotspot feature automatically turns off after a while if there are no connecting clients, there is no way to make it permanently ON anymore using windows configurations. As i wanted my hotspot to be permanently ON, here is PersistentHotspot!

PersistentHotspot uses the WindowsRuntime reference to access the Windows Runtime API that exposes the required interfaces such as NetworkOperatorTetheringManager.
Strangely, The only way to add a reference to Windows Runtime is to edit your .csproj manually and add the following references, why Microsoft why ?

```xml
<ItemGroup>
   ....
   ....
	<Reference Include="System.Runtime.WindowsRuntime, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089, processorArchitecture=MSIL">
	  <SpecificVersion>False</SpecificVersion>
	  <HintPath>$(MSBuildProgramFiles32)\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\Framework\.NETCore\v4.5\System.Runtime.WindowsRuntime.dll</HintPath>
